The NSDP Platform is built exclusively with open-source libraries and tools and can be hosted and maintained using free services. The key features of this platform are its ability to read data and visualise the information through graphs, tables and maps. The Platform facilitates Vanuatu to gather, disseminate, and track national or local data on the NSDP indicators, including identification of data gaps. Additionally, it improves access to official statistics and metadata; enabling Vanuatu to report national data in a harmonised format; and improving communication between data producers and users, custodian agencies, and other stakeholders.

Following the adoption of the National Sustainable Development Plan (NSDP) that has been aligned to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the indicators framework for monitoring progress (Fig.1 and Fig.2), there is a need to harness the data revolution to produce more and quality data that can truly drive development outcomes. Government institutions have struggled to systematically track progress against several development indicators because of the lack of data or the skills in understanding and using data to inform policymaking. The lack of data has often been due to challenges of accessibility, and the NSDP Platform will enable data to be open and available to all.

##### Structure of the NSDP online platform

The NSDP online platform is structured according to pillars, goals, policy objectives and the associated indicators (Figure 3). The Department of Strategic Policy, Planning & Aid Coordination (DSPPAC) reviews the strategy and its indicators in partnership with all government departments and adjusts them if necessary. For example, indicators can be replaced, or new ones added.

Each NSDP indicator is shown on its own page individually or together with an indicator that is closely related in terms of content. The development of the indicator and - as far as possible - the target to be achieved for Vanuatu are visualized in a graphic. The definitions and intentions as well as the development of the indicators are explained in the meta-data. For some indicators, the data can also be disaggregated. However, the indicated target to be achieved remains the nationwide target.

**Evaluation of the indicators**

For most indicators, a weather symbol - from sunshine to thunderstorms - shows in an easy-to-understand way how the indicator is moving on the desired path towards the target. Explanations on the definition of the symbols can be found [here](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/status/). Weather symbols for the last four years can be found under the "Status overview" button on the respective indicator page. Using the weather symbols, it is possible to roughly estimate how stable the development has been recently. However, they do not replace the explanatory texts with their background information. At the top of the NSDP page, you can click on the "Assessment" button and select "Overview" to display the [entire temporal development of the weather symbols for all indicators](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/status_summary/).

**Technical background**

In order to be able to present the data in a processed form, the open source project Open SDG on GitHub offers a standardized template for an online platform. You can find more about this under Technical Notes.
