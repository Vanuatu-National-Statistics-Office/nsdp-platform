ComputationMethod: Number of Households using renewable energy divides by total number
  of households multiply by 100.
ComputationUnit: Percentage (%)
Concept: These technologies allow us to heat and cool our buildings, generate electricity,
  and to travel by land, sea, and potentially also by air without generating dangerous
  greenhouse gases and other forms of pollution

Definition: "1. Renewable energy technologies\_enable us to create electricity, heat\
  \ and fuel from\_renewable sources. Solar, wind, hydro, wave, heat-exchange, tidal,\
  \ wave and bioenergy technologies are all powered by the sun, directly or indirectly.\
  \  2. Tidal and wave energy technologies are also powered by the moon. Geothermal\
  \ technologies are powered by deep heat from the Earth's core.   3.  Bioenergy technologies\
  \ allow us to convert the solar energy stored in plants, food wastes, farm wastes,\
  \ forest wastes, sewage, and algae into heat, electricity and fuel, using a variety\
  \ of approaches                            "
