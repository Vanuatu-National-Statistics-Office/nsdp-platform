Definition: >-
  The average incidence of food poverty at the household level, also known as
  the Food Poverty Line, refers to the proportion or percentage of households
  within a given population that do not have access to an adequate and
  nutritious diet due to financial constraints. It is a measure used to assess
  the extent of food insecurity and poverty in a specific area or country.
Concept: >-
  The concept of the average incidence of food poverty at the household level,
  also known as the Food Poverty Line, refers to the percentage or proportion of
  households within a specific population that lack access to a sufficient and
  nutritious diet due to financial constraints. It serves as a measure to assess
  the extent of food insecurity and poverty within a given area or country. The
  Food Poverty Line is typically determined by estimating the minimum income or
  expenditure required to meet basic nutritional needs, considering factors such
  as regional dietary patterns and nutritional guidelines. By comparing the
  income or expenditure of households to this threshold, those falling below it
  are considered to be living in food poverty. Monitoring the average incidence
  of food poverty enables policymakers and organizations to gauge the prevalence
  and severity of food insecurity, identify social inequalities, and design
  targeted interventions to address food poverty and promote food security.

Rationale: >-
  The indicator of the average incidence of food poverty at the household level,
  or the Food Poverty Line, is a crucial measure that provides valuable insights
  into the state of food insecurity and poverty within a population. Its
  rationale lies in the need to identify and address the challenges faced by
  households in accessing an adequate and nutritious diet. By quantifying the
  proportion of households living in food poverty, policymakers and
  organizations can assess the scale and scope of the issue, enabling them to
  design targeted interventions and policies to alleviate hunger and improve
  food security. This indicator helps in understanding the economic well-being
  and social inequalities prevailing in a society, as well as in evaluating the
  effectiveness of poverty reduction strategies. It also serves as a monitoring
  tool to track progress over time and to compare food poverty rates across
  different regions or countries, facilitating evidence-based decision-making
  and resource allocation to tackle the underlying causes of food insecurity.
  Ultimately, the aim is to ensure that all individuals and households have
  access to sufficient and nutritious food, promoting their well-being and
  contributing to a more equitable and sustainable society
MethodOfComputation: >-
  The average incidence of food poverty at the household level is calculated by
  comparing the income or expenditure of each household to the Food Poverty
  Line. If a household's income falls below this threshold, it is considered to
  be living in food poverty. The average incidence is then calculated as the
  percentage of households below the Food Poverty Line within a given
  population.
