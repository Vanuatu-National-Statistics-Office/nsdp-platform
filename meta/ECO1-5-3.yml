SDGAlignment: 17.11.1
Definition: >-
  Balance of trade (BOT) is the difference between the value of a country's exports
  and the value of a country's imports for a given period. Balance of trade is the
  largest component of a country's balance of payments (BOP). Sometimes the balance
  of trade betrween a countries goods and the balance of trade between its services
  are distinguished as two seperate figures
Concept: >-
  Economists use the BOT to measure the relative strength of a country's economy
Rationale: >-
  A country that imports more goods and services that it exports in terms of value has
  a trade deficit or a negative trade balance. Conversely, a country that exports more
  goods and services than it imports has a trade surplus or a psoitive trade balance.
MethodComputation: >-
  The formula for calculating the BOT can be simplified as the total value of exports minus
  the total value of its imports.
