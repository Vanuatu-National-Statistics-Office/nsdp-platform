Often expressed as a percentage, this ratio can also be interpreted as the number of years needed to pay back debt, if GDP is dedicated entirely to debt repayment.
A country able to continue paying interest on its debt--without refinancing, and without hampering economic growth, is generally considered to be stable. A country with a high debt-to-GDP ratio typically has trouble paying off external trades (also called “public debts”), which are any balances owed to outside lenders.

Trade is a basic economic concept involving the buying and selling of goods and services, with compensation paid by a buyer to a seller, or the exchange of goods or services between parties.","Trade agreements aim to strike a balance between flexibility and commitments. If there is too much flexibility, the value of the commitment is undermined. If there is too little flexibility, countries may refuse to make deep commitments or may easily renege on such commitments. This section explores how this trade-off works. It reviews the economic rationale for international trade cooperation and explains the reason for the inclusion of flexibilities in a trade agreement. It is important to highlight the distinction between the initial motivations for introducing flexibilities and the consequences of using such flexibilities. This section focuses on the reasons for including flexibilities while the effects of specific measures are examined in Sections

Economists have identified several rationales for the existence of trade agreements, such as those embodied in the WTO, and its antecedent, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 

Two main approaches can be distinguished.
1.	The first states that in the absence of a trade agreement, a country may be tempted to manipulate the terms-of-trade (i.e. the price of its exports relative to its imports) in order to increase its national income at the expense of its trading partners.
