  (Net Operating Balance (surplus))

  The actual change in the annual budget surplus in 2021 is approximately
  -211.76% of the target increase of 15% by 2030. This indicates that the budget
  surplus is not progressing positively towards the target, and significant
  improvements are needed to ensure the target is met by 2030.


  (Net Operating Balance Excluding Donors (deficit))

  The actual change in the annual budget position excluding donor contributions
  in 2021 is approximately 85.1% towards the target increase of 15% by 2030.
  This suggests that the budget position is progressing positively towards the
  target, but further improvements are needed to ensure the target is met by
  2030.
