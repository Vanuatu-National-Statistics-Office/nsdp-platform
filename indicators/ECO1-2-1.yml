  The government revenue increased by 62.5% from 2016 to 2022, which exceeds the
  target increase of 30% by 2030. This indicates that the government has been
  successful in increasing revenue over the specified period and is progressing
  well towards meeting the target. However, it's important to note that
  sustaining this growth rate until 2030 will be crucial to meeting the target.
  Continued efforts to increase revenue through various means such as economic
  growth, tax reforms, and efficient fiscal management will be necessary to
  ensure continued progress towards the target.
