  The GDP growth rate fluctuated over the years, starting at 4.7% in 2016,
  dropping to 2.9% in 2018, and reaching a low of -5% in 2020. These
  fluctuations suggest a volatile economic performance. To achieve the target of
  an increase by 4% by 2030, there would need to be a significant improvement in
  economic growth, particularly to recover from the contraction experienced in
  2020.
