  Calculate the proportion: Calculate the proportion of households engaged in
  food production by dividing the number of households meeting the criteria by
  the total number of households in the census data. Multiply the result by 100
  to express it as a percentage.


  Mathematically, the proportion can be calculated as:


  Proportion = (Number of households engaged in food production / Total number
  of households) * 100
