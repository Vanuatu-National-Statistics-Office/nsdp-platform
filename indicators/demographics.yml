  ## Resource allocation and service delivery


  Demographics statistics about the population of a particular geography such as
  your province, constituency, area council or nation profoundly affect how
  important decisions are made. Demographic data offers one source of reliable
  data that provides valuable insights about a community’s future infrastructure
  needs, resource allocation, and demand for services. They also help determine
  where aid and assistance programs are targeted, what businesses might move to
  your community, and how your vote counts in an election. All area council,
  constituency, provincial and national Plans, which present a vision for growth
  and development, should include a section dedicated to demographic trends that
  informs and/or relates to the community vision.​
