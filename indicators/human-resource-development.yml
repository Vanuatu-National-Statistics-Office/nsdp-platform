  ## HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT
 The Government of Vanuatu has identified that if the objectives embodied in 
 the National Sustainable Development Plan 2016-2030 (NSDP) are to be achieved, 
 it is necessary to develop and implement a National Human Resource Development Plan
(NHRDP). In recognition that human resource development is one of the key engines for 
sustainable economic and social development,the Government envisages that the NHRDP 
will clarify priority areas for education and training investment (including
scholarships) over the medium to longer term. Importantly, the NSDP notes that there 
are no quick and easy ways to create jobs and income earning opportunities for everyone. 
It takes prolonged and deliberate action. Limited resources require greater prioritisation 
of spending, while keeping expenditure pressures to manageable levels.
